# GroupProject1
* I have initiated django in our project to run our backend. 
* when Akram is ready we will hook the front to the back. We will start with a single project and add different app sections as we progress.
* if you pull the code to your virtual enviroment, make sure python is installed.
* If you navigate to the folder for this django project, to validate that django is properly set up copy and paste http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your borwser
        * You’ll see a “Congratulations!” page, with a rocket taking off. It worked!

* We will now build on this
